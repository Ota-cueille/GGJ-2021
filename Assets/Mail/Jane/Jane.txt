Hi !
I don't want to be mean, but your site is broken !
I just subscribed yesterday, I saved my GitHub password,
but this morning, I wanted to see who pushed on the
project I am working on for work, but I could not
connect to GitHub : when I ask storemypasswords.com
to give me the password, it gave me a file instead...
I think it is a log file, but I didn't really want to
open it. So I paid for something that doesn't work !
I want to be refunded.
Gratefully yours Jane
